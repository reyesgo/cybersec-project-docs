## **Vulnerability Assessment**

The assessment uncovered the following critical vulnerabilities in the target:

### Port Scanning

- Description: Method to determine what ports are open.

- Impact: Attackers can discover vulnerabilities associated with each visible open port with a port scan.

### Broken Authentication

- Description: Broken Authentication attacks are used to exploit user accounts. 

- Impact: Attackers that can obtain valid credentials can have access to password-protected directories and files. 

### Sensitive Data Exposure

- Description: Sensitive Data is any information that is meant to be protected from unauthorized access. 

- Impact: If Attackers can obtain exposed credentials they will be able to elevate their access to other resources in the domain/server.

### Local File Inclusion

- Description: Local File Inclusion is an attack that happens when an application includes a file as user input without properly validating it.

- Impact: Attackers can trick the web application into running malicious files on the web server.


## **Exploitation**

- ### Port scanning

   - ### Tools & Processes

      - Due to open ports being visible during a Nmap scan, I was able to determine the victim's IP address as well as the port and service version being used to host a web server.

   - ### Achievements

      - I was able to find the IP address of the server and determine that the server was using port 80 to host the website.

- ### Broken Authentication

   - ### Tools & Processes

      - The tool I used to exploit the web serverâ€™s broken authentication vulnerability was by using hydra to perform a brute force attack. The web servers list the name of the person in charge of system administration. I used their name as the username and used a wordlist to brute force the password with hydra.

   - ### Achievements

      - The exploited granted access to a restricted secret folder that contained a file describing the process to gain access to the WebDAV directory.

- ### Sensitive Data Exposure

   - ### Tools & Processes

      - After gaining access to the file in the restricted secret folder, I found a hash value. I used john the ripper to crack the password.

   - ### Achievements

      - The exploited granted access to the WebDAV folder.

- ### Local File Inclusion

   - ### Tools & Processes

      - After gaining access to the WebDAV server I was able to craft a PHP reverse shell payload using msfvenom and uploaded the payload to the server. I also set up a listener using the Metasploit framework to catch the reverse shell after being executed.

   - ### Achievements

      - The exploit granted access to the web server operating system.

## **Proposed Alarms and Mitigation Strategies**

- ### Blocking the Port Scan

   - ### Alarm

    - #### What kind of alarm can be set to detect future port scans?

      - We can set up an email alert.

    - #### What threshold would you set to activate this alarm?

      - The threshold for the alert should be for 10 or more incoming packets that are requesting information about different ports from a single source in under a minute.

   - ### System Hardening

   - #### What configurations can be set on the host to mitigate port scans?

      - Configure the firewall to enable packet filtering to mitigate port scanning. Deny all ICMP requests from external hosts.

      - Setup a SIEM platform for monitoring port scan activity in real-time and set up response measures such as alerts for rapid response if needed.

 - ### Finding the Request for the Hidden Directory
   
   - ### Alarm   

   - #### What kind of alarm can be set to detect future port scans?

      - Set up an email alert.

   - #### What threshold would you set to activate this alarm?

      - The threshold of the alert should be set to 3 failed attempts from a single internal IP address. External IP address failed attempts should trigger on each attempt.

   - ### System Hardening

   - #### What configurations can be set on the host to mitigate port scans?

      - Implement error redirection, such as denying any feedback to attackers by displaying an HTTP response code.

      - Adjust password policy requirements for users that have access to hidden directories.

      - Encrypt contents within hidden directories.

- ### Preventing Brute Force Attacks

   - #### What threshold would you set to activate this alarm?

      - The alert should trigger after 5 consecutive failed attempts.

   - ### System Hardening

   - #### What configurations can be set on the host to mitigate port scans?

      - Limit login attempts by locking the user account for some time after 5 consecutive failed attempts.

      - Use a secure platform session manager to randomly generate session identifiers.

      - Setup MFA for all users so in the event a threat actor does acquire valid credentials they are unable to authenticate through additional factors required by MFA.

- ### Detecting the WebDAV Connection

   - ### Alarm

   - #### What kind of alarm can be set to detect future port scans?

      - Set up an email alert for login attempts and log-in location.

   - #### What threshold would you set to activate this alarm?

      - The alert for failed attempts should trigger after 5 failed attempts. The alert for the login location should trigger every time an uncommon location is detected on log-in attempt.

   - ### System Hardening

   - #### What configurations can be set on the host to mitigate port scans?

      - Limit login attempts by locking the user account for some time after 5 consecutive failed attempts.

      - Only allow terminals that hold a recognized SSL certificate to connect to the WebDAV. 

      - Setup MFA for all users so in the event a threat actor does acquire valid credentials they are unable to authenticate through additional factors required by MFA.

- ### Identifying Reverse Shell Uploads

   - ### Alarm

   - #### What kind of alarm can be set to detect future port scans?

      - Set up an email alert.

   - #### What threshold would you set to activate this alarm?

      - The alert should trigger every time anyone attempts to upload an executable file.

   - ### System Hardening

   - #### What configurations can be set on the host to mitigate port scans?

      - Limit allowed file types to avoid executable files from being uploaded.

      - Setup an anti-malware engine such as McAfee Gateway Anti-Malware engine to scan all uploaded files for malware.

      - Store uploaded files outside of the website's public directory to prevent attackers from executing any uploaded files.
