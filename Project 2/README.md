## **Network Topology**

### **Network**

Address Range: 192.168.1.0/24

Netmask: 255.255.255.0

Gateway: 192.168.1.1

### **Machines**

|IPv4         |OS            |Hostname|
|-------------|--------------|--------|
|192.68.1.1   |Windows 10    |Hyper-V |

## **Red Team: Security Assesment**

### **Recon: Describing the Target**

Nmap Identified the following hosts on the network:

|Hostname       |IP Address     |Role of Network|
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
|Hyper-V        | 192.168.1.1   | Hypervisor    |
|Kali           | 192.168.1.90  | Attack Machine|
|ELK            | 192.168.1.100 | Monitoring Machine|
|Captstone      | 192.168.1.105 | Victim Machine|

### **Vulnerability Assesment**

The assesment uncovered the following critical vulnerabilities in the target:

### Port Scanning

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description: Method to determine what ports are open.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impact: Attackers can discover vulnerabilities associated with each visible open port with a port scan.

### Broken Authentication

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description: Broken Authentication attacks are used to exploit user accounts. 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impact: Attackers that are able to obtain valid credentials are able to have access to password protected directories and files. 

### Sensitive Data Exposure

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description: Sensitive Data is any information that is meant to be protected from unauthorized access. 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impact: If Attackers are able to obtain exposed credentials they will be able to elevate their access to other resources in the domain/server.

### Local File Inclusion

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description: A Local File Inclusion are attacks that happen when an application includes a file as user input without properly validating it.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impact: Attackers are able to trick the web application into running malicious files on the web server.

### **Exploitation**

### Port scanning

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tools & Processes

Due to open ports being visible during a Nmap scan, I was able to determine the victims IP address as well as the port and service version being used to host a web server.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achievements

I was able to find the IP address of the server and determine that the server was using port 80 to host the website.

### Broken Authentication

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tools & Processes

The tools I used to exploit the web serverâ€™s broken authentication vulnerability was by using hydra to perform a brute force attack. The web servers lists the name of the person in charge of system administration. I used their name as the username and used a wordlist to brute force the password with hydra.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achievements

The exploited granted access to a restricted secret folder that contained a file describing the process to gain access to the webdav directory. 

### Sensitive Data Explosure

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tools & Processes

After gaining access to the file in the restricted secret folder, I found a hash value.
I used john the ripper to crack the password.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achievements

The exploited granted access to the webdav folder. 

### Local File Inclusion

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tools & Processes

After gaining access to the webdav server I was able to craft a PHP reverse shell payload using msfvenom and uploaded the payload to the server. I also setup a listener using the metasploit framework in order to catch the reverse shell after being executed.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achievements

The exploit granted access to the web server operating system.
