## **Vulnerability Assesment**

The assesment uncovered the following critical vulnerabilities in the target:

### Port Scanning

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description: Method to determine what ports are open.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impact: Attackers can discover vulnerabilities associated with each visible open port with a port scan.

### Broken Authentication

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description: Broken Authentication attacks are used to exploit user accounts. 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impact: Attackers that are able to obtain valid credentials are able to have access to password protected directories and files. 

### Sensitive Data Exposure

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description: Sensitive Data is any information that is meant to be protected from unauthorized access. 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impact: If Attackers are able to obtain exposed credentials they will be able to elevate their access to other resources in the domain/server.

### Local File Inclusion

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description: A Local File Inclusion are attacks that happen when an application includes a file as user input without properly validating it.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impact: Attackers are able to trick the web application into running malicious files on the web server.


## **Exploitation**

### Port scanning

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tools & Processes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to open ports being visible during a Nmap scan, I was able to determine the victims IP address as well as the port and service version being used to host a web server.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achievements

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was able to find the IP address of the server and determine that the server was using port 80 to host the website.

### Broken Authentication

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tools & Processes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tools I used to exploit the web serverâ€™s broken authentication vulnerability was by using hydra to perform a brute force attack. The web servers lists the name of the person in charge of system administration. I used their name as the username and used a wordlist to brute force the password with hydra.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achievements

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exploited granted access to a restricted secret folder that contained a file describing the process to gain access to the webdav directory.

### Sensitive Data Explosure

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tools & Processes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After gaining access to the file in the restricted secret folder, I found a hash value. I used john the ripper to crack the password.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achievements

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exploited granted access to the webdav folder.

### Local File Inclusion

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tools & Processes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After gaining access to the webdav server I was able to craft a PHP reverse shell payload using msfvenom and uploaded the payload to the server. I also setup a listener using the metasploit framework in order to catch the reverse shell after being executed.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achievements

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exploit granted access to the web server operating system.

## **Proposed Alarms and Mitigation Strategies**

### Blocking the Port Scan

#### Alarm

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of alarm can be set to detect future port scans?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can setup-up an email alert.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What threshold would you set to activate this alarm?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The threshold for the alert should be for 10 or more incoming packets that are requesting information about different ports from a single source in under a minute.

#### System Hardening

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What configurations can be set on the host to mitigate port scans?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Configure the firewall to enable packet filtering to mitigate port scanning. Deny all ICMP requests from external hosts.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setup a SIEM platform for monitoring port scan activity in real-time and setup response measures such as alerts for rapid response inf needed

### Finding the Request for the Hidden Directory

#### Alarm

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of alarm can be set to detect future port scans?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setup an email alert.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What threshold would you set to activate this alarm?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The threshold of the alert should be set to 3 failed attempts from a single internal IP address. External IP address failed attempts should trigger on each attempt.

#### System Hardening

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What configurations can be set on the host to mitigate port scans?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implement error redirection, such as to deny any feedback to attackers by displaying a HTTP response code.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjust password policy requirements for users that have access to hidden directories.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encrypt contents within hidden directories.

### Preventing Brute Force Attacks

#### Alarm

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of alarm can be set to detect future port scans?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setup an email alert.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What threshold would you set to activate this alarm?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alert should trigger after 5 consecutive failed attempts.

#### System Hardening

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What configurations can be set on the host to mitigate port scans?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limit login attempts by locking the user account for a period of time after 5 consecutive failed attempts.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use a secure platform session manager to randomly generate session identifiers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setup MFA for all users so in the event a threat actor does acquire valid credentials they are unable to aunthenticate through additional factors required by MFA.

### Detecting the WebDAV Connection

#### Alarm

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of alarm can be set to detect future port scans?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setup an email alert for login attempts and login location.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What threshold would you set to activate this alarm?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alert for failed attempts should trigger after 5 failed attempts. The alert for the login location should trigger every time an uncommon location is detected on login attempt.

#### System Hardening

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What configurations can be set on the host to mitigate port scans?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limit login attempts by locking the user account for a period of time after 5 consecutive failed attempts.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only allow terminals that hold a recognized SSL certificate to connect to the WebDAV. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setup MFA for all users so in the event a threat actor does acquire valid credentials they are unable to authenticate through additional factors required by MFA.

### Identifying Reverse Shell Uploads

#### Alarm

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of alarm can be set to detect future port scans?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setup an email alert.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What threshold would you set to activate this alarm?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alert should trigger every time anyone attempts to upload an executable file.

#### System Hardening

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What configurations can be set on the host to mitigate port scans?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limit allowed file types to avoid executable files from being uploaded.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setup an anti-malware engine such as McAfee Gateway Anti-Malware engine to scan all uploaded files for malware.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Store uploaded files outside of the websites public directory to prevent attackers from executing any uploaded files.
