## **Recon: Describing the Target**

Nmap Identified the following hosts on the network:

|Hostname       |IP Address     |Role of Network|
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
|Hyper-V        | 192.168.1.1   | Hypervisor    |
|Kali           | 192.168.1.90  | Attack Machine|
|ELK            | 192.168.1.100 | Monitoring Machine|
|Captstone      | 192.168.1.105 | Victim Machine|



## **Vulnerability Assesment**

The assesment uncovered the following critical vulnerabilities in the target:

### Port Scanning

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description: Method to determine what ports are open.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impact: Attackers can discover vulnerabilities associated with each visible open port with a port scan.

### Broken Authentication

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description: Broken Authentication attacks are used to exploit user accounts. 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impact: Attackers that are able to obtain valid credentials are able to have access to password protected directories and files. 

### Sensitive Data Exposure

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description: Sensitive Data is any information that is meant to be protected from unauthorized access. 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impact: If Attackers are able to obtain exposed credentials they will be able to elevate their access to other resources in the domain/server.

### Local File Inclusion

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description: A Local File Inclusion are attacks that happen when an application includes a file as user input without properly validating it.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impact: Attackers are able to trick the web application into running malicious files on the web server.


## **Exploitation**

### Port scanning

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tools & Processes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to open ports being visible during a Nmap scan, I was able to determine the victims IP address as well as the port and service version being used to host a web server.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achievements

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was able to find the IP address of the server and determine that the server was using port 80 to host the website.

### Broken Authentication

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tools & Processes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tools I used to exploit the web serverâ€™s broken authentication vulnerability was by using hydra to perform a brute force attack. The web servers lists the name of the person in charge of system administration. I used their name as the username and used a wordlist to brute force the password with hydra.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achievements

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exploited granted access to a restricted secret folder that contained a file describing the process to gain access to the webdav directory.

### Sensitive Data Explosure

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tools & Processes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After gaining access to the file in the restricted secret folder, I found a hash value. I used john the ripper to crack the password.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achievements

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exploited granted access to the webdav folder.

### Local File Inclusion

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tools & Processes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After gaining access to the webdav server I was able to craft a PHP reverse shell payload using msfvenom and uploaded the payload to the server. I also setup a listener using the metasploit framework in order to catch the reverse shell after being executed.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achievements

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exploit granted access to the web server operating system.

## **Log Analysis**

### Identifying the Port Scan

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What time did the port scan occur?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The port scan occurred at 1:53pm based on the logs.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many packets were sent, and from which IP address?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,100 packets were sent.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What indicates that this was a port scan?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The destination ports for each packet were all different.

### Finding the Request for the Hidden Directory

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What time did the request occur? How many request were made?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The request occurred at 2:34pm.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 request was made.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which files were requested? What did they contain?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The file requested was "secret_folder".
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It contains the "connect_to_corp_server" file.

### Uncovering the Brute Force Attack

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many requests were made in the attack?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 15,606 requests made during the brute force attack.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many requests had been made before the attacker discovered the password?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the logs there were very few requests made before the attack.

### Finding the WebDAV Connection

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many requests were made to this directory?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22 requests were made to the WebDAV directory.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which files were requested?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Password.dav and payload.php were requested.
